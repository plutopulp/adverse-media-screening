    "content": "Skip to main contentSkip to navigation\n\nSkip to navigation\n\nHasan Mutlu among dozens held in Istanbul raids, the latest move in wave of arrests targeting CHP mayors\n\nShare\n\nTurkish authorities detained the mayor of an Istanbul district on Saturday, along with 47 officials, as part of a corruption investigation, continuing a crackdown on the country’s main opposition party.\n\nHasan Mutlu, mayor of Istanbul’s Bayrampaşa district, was taken into custody early Saturday on charges including bribery, embezzlement, fraud and bid rigging by the municipality, according to state broadcaster, TRT Haber.\n\nThe Istanbul police reportedly raided 72 locations, seizing documents and detaining Mutlu and several of his deputies.\n\nMutlu denied the allegations on X, writing: “I have served only Bayrampaşa and you, my esteemed fellow citizens ... What has happened consists of political operations and baseless slanders.”\n\nHe is the latest in a line of more than a dozen mayors from the Republican People’s party (CHP), along with hundreds of officials, to be arrested in recent months on corruption allegations, including Istanbul’s mayor, Ekrem İmamoğlu.\n\nİmamoğlu, who is regarded as president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s main rival, was arrested and detained in March, triggering widespread protests in Turkey.\n\nOn Friday, he stood trial on charges of falsifying his university degree, with his next hearing scheduled for October. The prosecution is seeking a jail term of up to eight years and nine months and a ban on political activities.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion\n\nSign up to This is Europe\n\nFree weekly newsletter\n\nThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environment\n\nPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The government denies the claims and says Turkey’s courts are independent.\n\nThe opposition made huge gains in local elections last year, retaining key cities such as Istanbul and Ankara, as well as making inroads into many strongholds of Erdoğan’s Justice and Development (AK) party.\n\nIn a pivotal case due to be heard in Ankara on Monday, a civil court will decide whether to annul the CHP’s 2023 congress, a decision that could change the party’s leadership, potentially causing internal chaos and weakening the party ahead of elections.\n\nThis article was amended on 15 September 2025. An earlier version incorrectly said that Istanbul’s mayor Ekrem İmamoğlu was the leader of the CHP.\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\nShare\n\nSign up for our email"
