EXTRACTION_PROMPT = """You are an information extraction agent for regulatory compliance and adverse media screening.

Extract ALL person entities mentioned in the article. For EACH entity, capture:

**Core Identity:**
- name (exact string from text)
- aliases (alternative references: "Mr. Smith", "the CEO", "the oligarch")
- age, birth_year, date_of_birth (if mentioned - CRITICAL for matching)

**Professional Context (STRUCTURED):**
- employments: List of employment records, each containing:
  * role: job title
  * organization: which company/institution
  * location: where they held this role
  * timeframe: "current", "former", "2018-2020", etc.
  * evidence_quote: exact sentence stating this employment

**Additional Identity (explicit only):**
- nationalities/citizenships (explicit only)
- place_of_birth (explicit only)
- identifiers (explicit only, if stated, e.g., case numbers)

**Relationships:**
- relationships: List of relationships to other entities:
  * related_entity_name: name of other person
  * relationship_type: worked_for, associate_of, investigated_by, sued_by, etc.
  * description: human-readable description
  * evidence_quote: sentence describing relationship

**Locations & Audit Trail:**
- locations: general location associations (cities, countries)
- mention_sentences: ALL sentences mentioning this person BY NAME OR REFERENCE
- mention_count: how many times mentioned (count of mention_sentences)
- extraction_confidence: 0-1 score of how confident you are about this entity

**CRITICAL COREFERENCE RESOLUTION:**
You MUST resolve coreferences when capturing mention_sentences. Include sentences where the entity is referenced by:

1. **Explicit name**: "Rachel Reeves said..."
2. **Pronouns**: "she said...", "he denied...", "they investigated...", "his resignation...", "her statement..."
3. **Role/title references**: "the chancellor announced...", "the former minister was...", "the prime minister's spokesperson..."
4. **Demonstratives**: "the oligarch denied...", "the accused appeared..."

**How to resolve coreferences:**
- Read the full article context carefully
- When you encounter a pronoun or reference, determine which entity it refers to based on:
  * Grammatical agreement (gender, number)
  * Proximity to last named mention
  * Context and subject matter
- Add that sentence to the correct entity's mention_sentences
- Be conservative - only include if you're confident about the reference (better to miss than misattribute)

**Examples:**

Article: "The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, must avoid risky tax increases. She will announce the budget next month. The chancellor faces pressure..."

Entity: Rachel Reeves
mention_sentences:
- "The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, must avoid risky tax increases." (explicit name)
- "She will announce the budget next month." (pronoun "she" = Rachel Reeves)
- "The chancellor faces pressure..." (role "the chancellor" = Rachel Reeves)
mention_count: 3

**Edge cases:**
- If uncertain about a pronoun reference, exclude it (better to miss than misattribute)
- If a sentence mentions multiple people, include it for all referenced entities
- Generic references ("officials say") should NOT be attributed unless specific person is clear
- Ambiguous pronouns (could refer to multiple entities) should be excluded



**CRITICAL RULES**:
1. Do NOT invent information not in the article
2. Each name must literally appear in text
3. Link roles to organizations in employments (solves "which role at which org" ambiguity)
4. Calculate mention_count by counting sentences (including coreferences)
5. Set extraction_confidence: 1.0 if very clear, lower if uncertain
6. RESOLVE COREFERENCES: Include pronoun and role references in mention_sentences
